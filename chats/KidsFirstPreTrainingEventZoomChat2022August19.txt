	https://zenodo.org/
11:29:49 From Danielle Daee to Everyone:
	Just wanting to make sure I understand.  So Zenodo is an open repository for data?  And github is a repository for the workflows?
11:30:21 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Again, the materials for the course are linked here: https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Kids-First-Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance
11:31:34 From Diana Ma to Everyone:
	Does Zenodo police restricted access data or is the author expected to do this?
11:31:57 From Hendrick Lim to Everyone:
	is there any capacity limitation of file size that can be stored in Zenodo after registration is made?
11:32:03 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	Can we use just zenodo instead of SRA or GO?
11:32:56 From Prithbey to Everyone:
	please share the recording video as the network is not good on my side to realize the all thing...

	Just a note about the CAVATICA developer token - this token has information that is coordinated with your access. You should keep this private to yourself - sharing it is like sharing your username and password with someone else.
11:42:01 From ajaypillai to Everyone:
	Will there be a video recording of this session available?
11:43:03 From Marisha Speights Atkins to Everyone:

11:43:07 From James Coulombe to Everyone:

11:43:17 From Angie Jelin to Everyone:

11:43:28 From Robert Carter to Everyone:
	üëç
11:43:40 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	I created a cavatica last year but didn't save anything. How can I access my authorization token now?
11:43:42 From jenniferlynnkrupp to Everyone:
	I only created an account in Github
11:44:00 From Diana Ma to Everyone:
	I am trying to creata an account in Cavatica, but the "Register" button does not work. Can you help?
11:44:02 From Pierrette Lo (she/her) to Everyone:
	thanks Anne & David! looking forward to next week.
11:44:27 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Angie: If you have an account but don't log in for 3 months, the account is locked as a security feature. Email support@sevenbridges.com and they will reset it for you. You'll still have everything you had last time you logged in.
11:44:46 From Angie Jelin to Everyone:
	Thank you!
11:45:24 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Diana: You may have to check the boxes confirming you've read the Terms, agree to the Privacy policy, and the reCAPTCHA.
11:46:50 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	Thank you for the kick start!
11:47:40 From Hendrick Lim to Everyone:
	Just to make sure, so cavatica platform is under sevenbridges?
11:47:41 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	Please show us how to use Jupyter.
11:48:31 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	CAVATICA is a cloud platform made by SevenBridges. If you're familiar with BioDataCatalyst, it's very similar.
11:49:20 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	I used up all my credits in Cavatica. I doubt if I will be allowed to run any work flows.
11:50:16 From Hendrick Lim to Everyone:
	I ever experienced with Cancer Genomics Cloud platform from SevenBridges. Just curious what is the difference with this CAVATICA platform
11:50:23 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	Yey.. thanks!
11:51:24 From jeeyh to Everyone:

11:53:56 From Diana Ma to Everyone:

11:54:33 From Prithbey to Everyone:

11:54:49 From Emily Boja to Everyone:
	Are you going to give us data as examples to analyze next week? Sorry if I missed it
11:55:17 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Yes, we have some open-access data to use next week
11:55:54 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:

11:56:02 From Emily Boja to Everyone:
	Awesome!
11:56:08 From MESAGAN to Everyone:
	pls send the link to this recording. thank you.
11:59:00 From Emily Boja to Everyone:
	A colleague in our office didn't register for the training but would like to attend. How would he access training next week if possible?
11:59:43 From Hendrick Lim to Everyone:
	is there any publication about CAVATICA to be cited when I used it in my future study?
12:00:21 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Emily: Yes, that should be possible - I will follow up with you.
12:00:34 From Emily Boja to Everyone:
	Thanks
12:00:50 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	I think there is a lag
12:01:17 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	It's okay
12:01:25 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Hendrick: I don‚Äôt think there's a CAVATICA publication to cite, I would just acknowledge that it was used in the Methods. "This work done on the CAVATICA cloud platform by SevenBridges" or something to that effect.
12:01:58 From Hendrick Lim to Everyone:
	got it, thank you
12:02:02 From Ken Wilkins to Everyone:
	^thanks @David, for addressing that natural question -- how do we obtain version?
12:02:08 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	I am convinced. It's great to be able to run a workflow on 400-1000 files.
12:02:10 From Emily Boja to Everyone:
	Thank you
12:03:41 From Ken Wilkins to Everyone:
	^@David -- found it under 'Release Notes' (currently shows Release note 08.08.22 )
12:03:42 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	The versions of software? It depends on how your tools are built. If you build your own, you'll track the versions. If you use a public app, the versions should be labeled in the documentation. "We used the alignment tool GATK v4.0‚Ä¶.‚Äù for example
12:04:33 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	But bills for clouds are still high. $1000 per month to start with Cavatica after free credits are finished. We had google cloud bill going $3000/month. SO need to use the server till I have grant to cover these costs.
12:04:35 From Ken Wilkins to Everyone:
	^ ah, yes the workflow's subpieces' versions seemed tacit, it was CAVATICA"s thanks -- makes sensee
12:05:42 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	Now learnt a lesson. Put the google cloud data in cold storage.
12:06:56 From Ken Wilkins to Everyone:
	Many thanks -- have to jump off, now -- enjoy the weekend (envious of the beautiful Conn. weather!)
12:07:00 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	Thanks for the suggestions! I will have to talk to my PI.
12:07:12 From MESAGAN to Everyone:
	bye
